<h1 align="center">Hello World 👋, I'm Gillian</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Full-Stack developer from Wallonia 🇧🇪</h3>

<br>
<br>

<p align="justify">I’m a junior full-stack developer and software engineering student at 42 Belgium, driven by a deep passion for technology, continuous learning, and crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. My journey into the digital world is rooted in curiosity and a diverse professional background that shaped my adaptable and creative mindset.</p>

<p align="justify">My professional path started outside tech: as a linguistics lecturer and digital learning manager, I honed skills in communication, pedagogy, and project management. These experiences taught me to think critically, solve problems effectively, and deliver meaningful solution, skills I now channel into software development.</p>

<p align="justify">At 42 Belgium, I’ve embraced the challenge of rigorous, peer-driven learning in software engineering, working on diverse projects, from algorithmic puzzles to full-fledged applications. I thrive on exploring new technologies and taking part in collaborative projects.</p>
